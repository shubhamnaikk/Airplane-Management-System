# Airplane-Management-System
The current system is manual, this system is slow, time consuming and it is very difficult for each person to book through office agents. Users inquire about the tickets through phones and it is very difficult for the user to remember all the details that they received through phones. It is very difficult to calculate how many peoples registered and how many seats on a particular plane are vacant .This requires quite a lot of time and wastage of money as it requires quite lot of manpower to do.
